// Also note that since our appsettings.json has been put in our .gitignore, users will not have access to it when cloning our project. This means that you will need to add specific instructions in your README that tells the user where to create the file, and what code to include in it. We recommend using the above formatting and directing users to replace [YOUR-USERNAME-HERE] and [YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE] with the user's own user and password values.
